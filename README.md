# Warehouse Robot Navigation System

## Description
This project involves designing and configuring the navigation system for the RB1 mobile robot in a warehouse environment. It includes generating a map of the warehouse using SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), setting up localization with AMCL, and configuring the Nav2 stack for autonomous navigation. The project is part of a robotics masterclass and is tested in both simulation and with a real RB1 robot.

## Key Features
- Warehouse mapping using Cartographer SLAM.
- Robot localization using AMCL.
- Autonomous navigation using the Nav2 system.
- Real robot testing and simulation in Gazebo.
